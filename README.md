# 100 Days of DSA in Java
Every day, I solve one Data Structures & Algorithms problem, write clean code, and share a beginner-friendly guide.  

About This Repo.  
• 100 days of consistent Java coding.  
• Step-by-step explanations for beginners.   
• Covers arrays, strings, hashmaps, sorting, recursion & more.  
• Both brute-force and optimized approaches when possible.
